# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this analysis was to create an automated pipeline that reads new data,  automates the cleaning of data, condenses the data, and loads the data into exisiting tables in a database. By using code that was previously created, I was able to refactor data into a function to make it more streamlined than before. Please see the results here: https://github.com/Jaila28/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_Clean_Kaggle_data.ipynb.ipynb
